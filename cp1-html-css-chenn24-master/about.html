      <h3>One of my favorite quotes</h3>
      <!--
        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure.
